# Fashion-Product-Recommendation-System
The Fashion Product Recommendation System is an AI-powered web app that suggests visually similar fashion items based on an uploaded image. Using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and cosine similarity for matching, it helps users find related products. Built with Flask, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Bootstrap, it's ideal for fashion e-commerce.
